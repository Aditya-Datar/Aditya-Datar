# Select wins, quick case studies

## Modern Core Migration, HSBC
â€¢ Problem, context: Legacy monoliths slowed feature delivery and caused fragile releases.  
â€¢ What I did: Replatformed payments logic into Java Spring Boot microservices, designed idempotent APIs, and added observability and safe migration lanes.  
â€¢ Outcome: Production APIs adopted by **1500+ internal users**, faster releases, fewer incidents.

## Automation that paid back
â€¢ Problem: Repetitive manual steps eating developer time and increasing errors.  
â€¢ What I did: Built Python automation to remove repetitive work across the development lifecycle.  
â€¢ Outcome: Saved **2200 dollars per resource** and reclaimed **8 hours** per developer each cycle.

## Smart Beehive, LoRa IoT system
â€¢ Problem: Beekeepers in remote regions had no affordable telemetry.  
â€¢ What I did: Built low power sensor nodes, encrypted LoRa transport, and cloud analytics. Filed patents and published results.  
â€¢ Outcome: Provisional and design patents filed, IEEE Xplore publication, field ready prototypes.

## OCR Allergen Detector
â€¢ Problem: Users with allergies need a fast, reliable way to check packaged products.  
â€¢ What I did: Led a team to build a mobile first OCR and CV pipeline with offline first UX and server validation.  
â€¢ Outcome: MVP validated in lab tests, ready for pilot deployment.

# Awards and recognition
â€¢ MIT WPU merit scholarships across all undergraduate years.  
â€¢ Multiple design patents and provisional patents for hardware and product innovations.  
â€¢ IEEE Xplore publication, Scopus indexed.  
â€¢ Internal recognition at HSBC for automation that delivered measurable cost savings.
