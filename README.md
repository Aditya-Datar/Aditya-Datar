# Hi, I am Aditya Datar ðŸ‘‹
**Software Engineer Â· M.S. Computer Science (USC) Â· Full stack, Backend, Frontend, Applied AI, IoT inventor**

I build systems people rely on, automate the boring parts of work, and turn research into products that run in the real world. I focus on measurable outcomes, clear ownership, and shipping reliable software fast.

## TL;DR
- Migrated Cobol legacy payments to Spring Boot microservices; APIs used by 1500+ staff.  
- Built Python automation that removed 8 hours of manual work per cycle and saved $2200 per resource.  
- Inventor on multiple patents and author of a Scopus-indexed IEEE paper.  
- B.Tech CSE: CGPA 9.71/10
